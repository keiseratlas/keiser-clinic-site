            <p>This is one of the most common questions we get: "Can deconditioning cause orthostatic issues? I'm severely deconditioned."</p>

            <p>And the way to think about this is actually pretty straightforward once you ask the right question.</p>

            <h2>Which Came First?</h2>

            <p>Did you have the orthostatic issues first, and then that created the lack of movement, which then created the deconditioning? Or did you just stop moving &mdash; got hooked on Breaking Bad or something &mdash; and then stopped moving, and then all of a sudden you started to get orthostatic problems?</p>

            <p>You can see where one is more of a catalyst than the other.</p>

            <p>If you're noticing that you were having orthostatic problems and <em>then</em> you could do less things &mdash; it probably wasn't the "doing less things" that caused the problem, right? And then we kind of work backwards and think about what could have been more causal, and can we solve that underlying problem.</p>

            <p>But if the deconditioning in and of itself is the thing that led to it, then we work on the conditioning as a way to build back up that tolerance.</p>

            <div class="article-callout">
                <p><strong>Here's what matters in both cases:</strong> Whether the deconditioning was the cause or not, once we're at a point where the underlying issue is addressed, you still have to build up the tolerance and build up the strength. So conditioning matters either way. The question is whether you can just exercise your way out, or whether there's something underneath that needs to be solved first. That's a big difference &mdash; and it's <a href="why-dysautonomia-treatments-fail.html">why a lot of treatment protocols fail</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why "Just Exercise" Doesn't Always Work</h2>

            <p>Here's where this gets practical. If your orthostatic problems came first &mdash; if <a href="exercise-intolerance-pots.html">you couldn't tolerate exercise</a> because standing up was already a problem &mdash; then telling you to exercise more is like telling someone with a broken leg to walk it off. The deconditioning isn't the root. It's the downstream effect of a system that isn't working.</p>

            <p>And one of the things we know is that if there's something else driving the orthostatic dysfunction &mdash; whether it's a problem with the vestibular system, with the neck, with how the brain is regulating blood flow &mdash; exercise alone won't fix that underlying mechanism. You'll just keep hitting a wall.</p>

            <h2>Quality Over Quantity</h2>

            <p>This is something we talk about all the time. We are a quality over quantity type of a field. Meaning it's way better to do two good ones than ten bad ones, because all those ten bad ones do is keep the circuit going of the faulty response. We want to break that faulty response with perfect ones.</p>

            <p>Think of it like doing less weight on the bar if you're doing a bench press, right? You pull the dosage down. You go really slow and controlled. You're trying to make it easier for the system to actually succeed at the task rather than just throwing volume at it and hoping something sticks.</p>

            <p>What we see very frequently is people saying "yeah, I do the exercises" and then when we ask what it looks like, they're doing it and their head is moving all crazy and their eyes are moving crazy and they're dizzy &mdash; and it's like, well, that's not a good idea. That's not rehab. That's just reinforcing the bad pattern.</p>

            <h2>The Dose Has to Match the Capacity</h2>

            <p>So in these instances, we say: we're not going to do that. We're going to do something that's more targeted toward making it smooth and accurate.</p>

            <p>If someone's system can't handle standing up, that's like the barbell being too heavy. So we take weight off. We find the level where the system can actually respond correctly, and we start there. Maybe that means lying down. Maybe it means having someone support your head. Maybe it means using a sensory trick that takes certain variables out of the equation so the brain can actually process what's left.</p>

            <p>And then we scale up. A little bit more difficult. A little bit more difficult. Next thing you know, you're sitting up. Next thing you know, you're moving around. That's the progression.</p>

            <div class="article-callout">
                <p><strong>When the neck complicates things:</strong> One thing we know is if there are injuries in the neck, that neck injury &mdash; if it causes an aberrant movement when you move your eyes and head, or even just in the way you position your head &mdash; it's going to create a pull in your eyes where the reflexes won't work as cleanly. And it can go the other direction too: if your eyes are jerking around, your body will try to become more still, and your neck will get tighter automatically through something called a cervical collic reflex. So sometimes we have to address eye stability on its own <em>without</em> involving the neck, let that reflex relax, and then start to incorporate neck movement. The order matters.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Figuring Out Which Mechanism Is Driving the System</h2>

            <p>So here's how we think about it. Number one: which faulty mechanism is actually driving the system? Is it the vestibular system? Is it the neck? Is it how the brain is regulating blood flow? We need to <a href="transcranial-doppler-pots.html">measure that</a> before we start throwing exercises at it.</p>

            <p>Number two: am I at a dose where I'm able to do the required task perfectly? If the answer is no, we need to pull back further than you'd think.</p>

            <p>And number three: is there an interaction between systems that we have to break apart? Sometimes gaze stabilization work, for example, involves moving the head on the neck. But if the neck is really problematic, we may have to do that in a whole-body format &mdash; still stimulating the vestibular-ocular system but taking the neck out of the game entirely. That might even be something we have to do laying down.</p>

            <p>The point is that "just exercise more" skips all of these questions. It assumes the answer before doing the diagnostic work. And for a lot of POTS patients, that's exactly why it doesn't work &mdash; not because they're not trying hard enough, but because nobody figured out what actually needed to be addressed first.</p>
