            <img src="../images/cognitive-reaction-testing.jpg" alt="Cognitive and autonomic testing for POTS" class="article-hero-img">

            <p>Most people think of POTS as a heart rate problem. Your heart rate goes up too much when you stand, so something must be wrong with your heart, right? But the heart is just doing what the brain is telling it to do. And the real question is: why is the brain telling it to do that?</p>

            <p>To understand that, you have to understand how heart rate actually works in the first place.</p>

            <h2>Your Heart Has a Set Rate &mdash; And Your Brain Slows It Down</h2>

            <p>OK so here's something most people don't know. Your heart has a resting rate it wants to beat at &mdash; and it's not 70. It's somewhere around 120. That's where the heart sits with no brain connected to it at all.</p>

            <p>If you've had kids, you might have noticed this. A six-year-old's heartbeat is faster than an adult's. That's because the brain hasn't fully developed that control yet.</p>

            <p>So what the brain does is it uses the parasympathetic system &mdash; the "brakes" &mdash; to slow the heart down from that 120 baseline. The more efficient your system is at maintaining blood pressure, the less your heart has to beat to keep pressure up. Which means the brain can apply more of that parasympathetic brake, slow the heart further, and that uses less energy. Pretty cool, right?</p>

            <h2>Brakes and Gas Pedals</h2>

            <p>So now think about what happens when you need to get up quickly or exert yourself. Your brain doesn't actually have to slam the gas pedal to get the heart going. All it has to do is let off the brakes. Just back off the parasympathetic inhibition, and the heart naturally climbs up toward that 100 to 120 range on its own.</p>

            <p>You don't have to do much at all to get there. Just release the brake.</p>

            <p>Now, if you're back on the soccer field and you need to take it above 120, <em>that's</em> when you shift over and push in sympathetic drive &mdash; the gas pedal. That takes you from around 120 up into the 170 range.</p>

            <p>This matters because when we're looking at someone with POTS, there's a real physiological difference between a heart rate that jumps from 70 to 120 versus one that jumps from 70 to 150. Both are a big jump. But the physiology happening underneath is different.</p>

            <div class="article-callout">
                <p><strong>Why does the number matter?</strong> If your heart rate goes to 120, your brain may just be releasing the brakes &mdash; backing off parasympathetic control. But if it's hitting 150, a new signal has been introduced. You've had to engage the sympathetic system on top of releasing the brakes. Those are different mechanisms, and they point to different things going on in the brain's coordination of the autonomic system.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>What Your Resting Heart Rate Tells You</h2>

            <p>Same idea applies to where your heart rate sits at rest. If someone's resting heart rate is cruising around 100, that tells you something very different than if it starts at 65 or 70.</p>

            <p>A resting rate around 100 means the brain's ability to provide that parasympathetic inhibition &mdash; the brakes &mdash; is either not working well, or the brain has decided it shouldn't apply those brakes in order to maintain the current state. Either way, the brain is involved.</p>

            <h2>POTS Is Really an Energy Problem</h2>

            <p>At the end of it, the autonomic system really comes down to energy. How do we make it? How do we mobilize it? And how do we make the whole thing efficient and recoverable &mdash; so that when you spend energy, you can replenish the system and spend it again?</p>

            <p>Dr. Keiser actually moves people away from the classic "rest and digest" versus "fight or flight" framing. Instead, think about it in terms of: how much energy am I using, and is that efficient?</p>

            <p>If your heart is cranking at 120 just to eat an orange on the couch, that's not efficient. And so the question becomes: why does your body have to do that to maintain its current state? Are there things you can do so your body can be more efficient &mdash; so you're not burning all this energy just to do really simple tasks?</p>

            <h2>The Norepinephrine Confusion</h2>

            <p>A lot of POTS patients get their norepinephrine levels tested and see elevated numbers. So let's clear something up.</p>

            <p>Norepinephrine is the chemical that sympathetic nerves use at the junction between one nerve and the next. You send an electrical signal down the nerve, and at the end it releases a little bit of norepinephrine to start the electricity in the next nerve in line. It really only exists in this little gap between the two nerve endings.</p>

            <p>If your body has to really crank that sympathetic output to maintain blood flow to your head, you're going to produce more norepinephrine. You can measure it, and it goes up. Think of it like exhaust coming out of a tailpipe &mdash; if you're stomping on the gas pedal, there's more exhaust, because you're burning more fuel.</p>

            <p>The thing that confuses people is thinking norepinephrine is the same thing as epinephrine &mdash; adrenaline. Similar name, but not the same thing. Epinephrine is a metabolic hormone produced in the adrenal glands. It helps you pull glucose out of the liver, out of the muscles, out of the blood supply so you can use it. Norepinephrine goes between those two nerve endings so one sympathetic nerve can talk to the next one in line.</p>

            <p>So yes, norepinephrine can go up in POTS. It should go up if you're seeing increased vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, changes in respiration. That's just the system working harder.</p>

            <h2>Dual Tasking: When Thinking Makes Everything Worse</h2>

            <p>One of the things we test is called a dual task. It's a cognitive task coupled to another context &mdash; like doing a mental challenge while you're on a <a href="transcranial-doppler-pots.html">tilt test</a>.</p>

            <p>What we're looking at is: when you're trying to think, does the system respond the same way, or does it change?</p>

            <p>In some patients, cerebral perfusion actually goes <em>up</em> during the dual task. That's great &mdash; it means when the brain demanded more energy, the body was able to fulfill that demand. But in other patients, when you go to do that cognitive task, we actually see cerebral blood flow <em>drop</em>. That tells us the metabolic capacity isn't there. The brain asked for more, and the system couldn't deliver.</p>

            <p>That's a huge piece of understanding why <a href="brain-fog-causes.html">brain fog</a> hits so many POTS patients, especially when they try to think and be upright at the same time.</p>

            <h2>So What Actually Helps?</h2>

            <p>In a lot of these cases, what we're seeing underneath is a proprioceptive error in the control of head and neck function. The brain isn't getting accurate information about where the head is in space, and that messes with its ability to organize blood flow.</p>

            <p>The approach is a coordinated effort &mdash; it's not one thing. It's a combination of eye-head stimulus, coordinating eye and head movement with proprioceptive stimulation through neck afference. By recalibrating that signal, improving that signal ratio, the brain is actually able to organize blood flow better and control it more effectively.</p>

            <p>Think about it like this: you could take someone who has a problem accurately touching their finger to their nose &mdash; like pinning the tail on the donkey. By training the brain so it understands where the hand is better, it makes that task way easier. Same idea. We want to make sure the brain understands where you are. And the benefit of improving that proprioceptive output is that it's tied to the reflexes of the autonomic outputs.</p>

            <p>So when you improve how well the brain knows where the head and neck are, you also improve how well it can manage <a href="exercise-intolerance-pots.html">blood pressure, heart rate, and vascular tone</a> during movement and position changes.</p>
