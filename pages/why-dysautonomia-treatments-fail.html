            <p>OK so here's the thing that bugs me. You go to your doctor, you get a dysautonomia diagnosis, and then you get the standard protocol &mdash; medications to manage symptoms, maybe some supplements, maybe you're told to drink more water and salt. And for a lot of people, that just... doesn't work. Or it works a little bit. Or it works for a while and then stops.</p>

            <p>And then what? You try the next thing. And the next thing. And eventually you've been through the whole list and you're still feeling terrible.</p>

            <p>So the question I want to look at is: why? Why do these treatments fail for so many people? And I think the answer is actually simpler than most people expect.</p>

            <h2>The Dishwasher Problem</h2>

            <p>Let me give you an analogy. There was a time that we came home from visiting my wife's family up north. We were gone for a week, summertime. We came back and we noticed there was a smell in the house. Smelled wet. So that's number one &mdash; that's like the symptom, right?</p>

            <p>So then you start to look around. I go in the kitchen and I realize the floor is wet. Our wood floor is wet. And then further examination &mdash; dishwasher has malfunctioned and dumped all the water through the floor, it went under the floorboards, and that's why we have this smell.</p>

            <p>Now think about this in terms of a person. You wouldn't say "OK, we need to just rip all the flooring out everywhere. It's a water problem, so we should just take out all of the plumbing." We don't do any of that. We say "OK, let's put our energy, let's put our money into fixing the dishwasher." And then from there, we solve the problem of the wet floor.</p>

            <p>We started with a smell. That led us to a problem we can measure &mdash; the floor is wet. But ultimately we have to solve for the dishwasher to be able to fix it.</p>

            <p>And that's where most dysautonomia treatment goes wrong. People are mopping the wet floor over and over and over again. Nobody's looking at the dishwasher.</p>

            <h2>Shooting Into the Wind</h2>

            <p>So when we look at the difference between how different approaches handle this, there's kind of two extremes. On one end, conventional medicine says "here's something that can get rid of the thing you're feeling right now." Stomp the symptom. And the criticism is real &mdash; you might get a medication that manages the symptom, but there are tradeoffs in that equation, and you might not be fixing the thing underneath it.</p>

            <p>On the other end, you get the functional medicine approach where the testing starts to feel esoteric. Starts to feel fringy, right? And you end up looking scattershot at a whole human trying to pick apart all the things that aren't optimum, and then hoping that if you address enough of them, you'll solve the problem.</p>

            <p>One is squishing symptoms. The other is shooting into the wind and hoping you hit something.</p>

            <p>Neither one is actually saying: what is the one core error that, if we found it and fixed it, would explain why this person feels this way?</p>

            <h2>The Mold Example</h2>

            <p>Here's one that comes up a lot. We saw this recently &mdash; someone's diagnosed positive for mold. So the solution is detoxify, get rid of the mold. Makes sense on the surface.</p>

            <p>But then you look at their spouse. Same age. Similar upbringing. Lives in the same house, works out of the same house. Their environment is the same. Except he eats Cheetos, does whatever he wants, drinks some beer, isn't particularly active &mdash; not exactly a pillar of health. But he's doing fine.</p>

            <p>So then you're forced to the question: is it a problem with just this external environment, or is there something going on within the way that this person operates that is preventing them from being able to deal with that environment?</p>

            <p>I'm not hating on mold. Believe me, we've seen our share of people with mold and that's definitely a thing to address. But rather than getting hyperfocused on "I see this panel, I want to solve it," we can back up into &mdash; what is going on within this person that would prevent them from being able to handle it?</p>

            <div class="article-callout">
                <p><strong>The middle ground is actually really useful.</strong> If we can say "this person in front of me is feeling poorly, something probably happened that created a problem, and now they feel this way" &mdash; that gives us a place to do a deep analysis. Like looking at a car smashed up on the side of the road with bark knocked off a tree. Something happened here that took the car from driving great to not being able to start. We can figure out what that was.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>It All Comes Back to One Substrate</h2>

            <p>So here's where I'd actually think about the whole problem from a completely different angle. Because all of these things come back to one substrate. It all kind of comes back to the brain in the end.</p>

            <p>The brain is what's going to control the amount of immune response that you have. The sensitivity of the immune response that you have. So when we think about why someone can't handle mold but their spouse can, or why someone's <a href="autonomic-testing.html">autonomic system</a> isn't regulating properly, or why someone isn't recovering &mdash; there's a common thread there.</p>

            <p>And here's what's really interesting about healing in the brain. It takes three parts. Number one, you have to have oxygen. Full stop. You have to have oxygen to stimulate the brain. You've also got to have glucose &mdash; that's where we generate the energy from, that's how we make ATP to be able to use our brain.</p>

            <p>But the third part &mdash; the part that always gets left out but is the most important &mdash; is that it has to be <em>stimulated</em>. It has to be stimulated within a threshold that it can tolerate to grow.</p>

            <p>And this part's really interesting because it turns out you can add glucose and you can add oxygen into the system, but if you don't stimulate the actual neurons, nothing changes. The stimulation is the thing you need the most. And unfortunately, it's the thing that gets left out the most.</p>

            <h2>Why This Changes the Treatment Conversation</h2>

            <p>So if we understand this &mdash; that the core issue for a lot of people is how the brain is functioning &mdash; then the question stops being "which symptom do I manage next?" and starts being "what is going on in the brain that we can measure and address?"</p>

            <p>The good news is you <em>can</em> measure this. You can measure how different areas of the brain work, how the pathways work, how they work together. You can measure how well you're able to get <a href="transcranial-doppler-pots.html">blood flow into the brain</a>, how well that whole system works.</p>

            <p>And for many people, there's an unlock there. There's a way to use that as a catalyst to actually start to stimulate the brain in a way that allows it to improve functionality &mdash; in the immune system, in the autonomic system, in all the downstream things that are producing symptoms.</p>

            <p>Rather than trying to fix all the things, what if we focus on the one core problem? If you find the thing that's going to have the biggest effect on the overall function of the body &mdash; the thing that's related to the symptoms &mdash; now you have a bridge between "where does this symptom come from" and "how do we get past just trying to squish the symptom and actually let the body function fully so that symptom doesn't have to exist anymore."</p>

            <p>That's a very different conversation than "<a href="iv-saline-mecfs-dysautonomia.html">let's try more saline</a> and see if you feel better."</p>

                <p style="max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto 25px;">If you've tried the standard protocol and you're still symptomatic, a free consultation call can help determine whether our approach fits your situation.</p>
