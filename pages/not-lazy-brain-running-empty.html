            <img src="../images/keiser-clinic-patient-consultation.jpg" alt="Patient consultation at The Keiser Clinic discussing fatigue and brain fog symptoms" class="article-hero-img">

            <p>"I used to be able to do so much more."</p>

            <p>"I feel like I'm failing at everything."</p>

            <p>"People think I'm just not trying hard enough."</p>

            <p>If you have POTS, chronic fatigue, or dysautonomia, you've probably had these thoughts. And you've probably wondered if maybe everyone's right &mdash; maybe you ARE just lazy.</p>

            <p>You're not.</p>

            <h2>Your Brain Needs Fuel to Function</h2>

            <p>Your brain runs on oxygen and glucose. Both are delivered by blood. When blood flow to your brain drops, you're literally running on empty.</p>

            <div class="article-callout">
                <p><strong>&ldquo;Oxygen and glucose &mdash; they're like the substrate, the ingredients for making energy. If we're having a hard time being able to continually give the brain the ingredients, it makes it really hard to run it. You can't run the car on empty. Same with your brain.&rdquo;</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>This isn't a motivation problem. It's a supply problem.</p>

            <h2>What "Brain Fog" Actually Is</h2>

            <p>When people describe <a href="brain-fog-causes.html">brain fog</a>, they're often describing what happens when the brain doesn't have enough blood flow to process normally:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
                <li>Words not coming easily</li>
                <li>Feeling "fuzzy" or "off"</li>
                <li>Struggling with tasks that used to be automatic</li>
                <li>Mental exhaustion after minimal effort</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These symptoms make physiological sense. A brain that's not getting adequate fuel can't perform at full capacity &mdash; just like a phone at 5% battery goes into low-power mode.</p>

            <h2>The Numbers Tell the Story</h2>

            <p>This isn't theoretical. It's measurable.</p>

            <div class="article-callout">
                <p><strong>&ldquo;We know huge percentage of cases &mdash; 90 plus percent in the cerebral hypoperfusion case and 70 plus in the hypocapnia case.&rdquo;</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>90%+ of <a href="diagnose-chronic-fatigue-syndrome.html">chronic fatigue cases</a> show decreased blood flow to the brain when tested on a tilt table with transcranial Doppler. This is objective data, not speculation.</p>

            <h2>Your Body Is Trying to Compensate</h2>

            <p>When your brain isn't getting enough blood, your body does what it can to help. Your heart beats faster trying to push more blood upward. Your body might even trigger you to lie down &mdash; because horizontal equals easier blood flow to the brain.</p>

            <div class="article-callout">
                <p><strong>&ldquo;When she stands up and you're having a decrease in blood flow to your head, your heart's going to do the one thing it knows how to do in order to try to keep blood flow there &mdash; which is increase your heart rate.&rdquo;</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>The fatigue isn't weakness. It's your body trying to conserve resources for a brain that's not getting what it needs.</p>

            <h2>"Just Push Through" Doesn't Work Here</h2>

            <p>You can't willpower your way through inadequate fuel delivery. A car with an empty tank doesn't drive faster if you press the accelerator harder.</p>

            <p>The solution isn't trying harder. It's figuring out why blood isn't getting where it needs to go &mdash; and addressing that.</p>

            <h2>Bodies Can Heal</h2>

            <p>Here's what matters: when the underlying <a href="cerebral-hypoperfusion-causes.html">blood flow problem</a> is addressed, symptoms often improve together.</p>

            <div class="article-callout">
                <p><strong>&ldquo;Bodies heal. They heal themselves, right? That's where the process happens. We're just trying to create an environment where they do.&rdquo;</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>Patients who couldn't function have gotten their lives back &mdash; not by trying harder, but by identifying and addressing the actual mechanism behind their symptoms.</p>

            <h2>What This Means</h2>

            <p>If you're struggling with fatigue and brain fog:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>It's not laziness</strong> &mdash; Your brain may literally be running on reduced fuel</li>
                <li><strong>It's measurable</strong> &mdash; Transcranial Doppler on tilt can show what's happening to blood flow</li>
                <li><strong>It's not permanent</strong> &mdash; When blood flow regulation improves, symptoms often follow</li>
                <li><strong>"Pushing through" isn't the answer</strong> &mdash; Identifying the mechanism is</li>
            </ol>

            <p>You're not broken. You're not weak. You're not lazy.</p>

            <p>Your system is dealing with a supply problem &mdash; and that's something that can be addressed.</p>

                    "text": "No. POTS fatigue is not a motivation problem — it's a supply problem. Your brain runs on oxygen and glucose, both delivered by blood. When blood flow to the brain drops, the brain literally can't get the fuel it needs to function. As Dr. Keiser explains, you can't run the car on empty — same with your brain. The fatigue is your body conserving resources, not a lack of effort."

                    "@type": "Answer",
                    "text": "Brain fog in POTS is typically caused by reduced cerebral blood flow — the brain isn't getting enough oxygen and glucose to process normally. Over 90% of chronic fatigue cases show decreased blood flow to the brain when tested on a tilt table with transcranial Doppler. Symptoms like difficulty concentrating, words not coming easily, and mental exhaustion after minimal effort all make physiological sense when the brain is running on reduced fuel."

                    "@type": "Answer",
                    "text": "You can't willpower your way through inadequate fuel delivery — just as a car with an empty tank doesn't drive faster when you press the accelerator harder. The solution isn't trying harder. It's identifying why blood isn't getting where it needs to go and addressing the underlying mechanism. When blood flow regulation improves, symptoms often follow, and patients who couldn't function have gotten their lives back."
